Don’t break anything. Don’t rename anything. Don’t remove anything unless explicitly told. You are now restoring the Deep3 Social (B3) app to full operating condition.

You are the lead system developer for Deep3 Social — a Web3 education-first social media platform, built for teachers, educators, and parents to share content related ONLY to AI and education.

Your mission:
1. Rebuild the entire homepage, about page, registration/login pages, user profile, and social feed.
2. Match the visual structure and layout of Bluesky (bsky.app) — simple, clean, with timeline-first UI.
3. All pages must be mobile-first, Tailwind CSS styled, and fully responsive.

🔥 Key Features:
- Email-based sign-up (no wallet required unless minting)
- After email/password signup: prompt to create full profile (name, profile pic, role: Teacher, Parent, Educator)
- All work email registrations (like .edu or .org) are marked “Needs Approval”
- Admin (derrickshaw@playpulseai.com) will approve and assign checkmarks to verified teachers
- Content allowed: AI-related or education-related only
- Moderation agents silently monitor content for unrelated/off-topic posts
- Users can post text, upload images, and upload short videos (mp4 only, keep light)
- Likes, reposts, comments, and share buttons for each post
- NFT Minting optional: When uploading a post, user can select “Mint this post” (show fee info)
- No wallet connection shown until minting — default wallet is Foxfire, but user can connect any
- Mint fees shown on mint screen only (add placeholder fee table: platform fee, royalty, gas)
- Profile pages show profile picture, name, role, checkmark (if approved), and post history
- Feed algorithm shows all public posts chronologically (since this is an early-stage platform)
- Users must register and create profile before viewing full feed

⚙️ Infrastructure Requirements:
- Use Firebase for:
  - Auth (email/password)
  - Firestore (users, posts, roles, verifications)
  - Storage (images, videos)
  - Admin functions (approval, deletion, logs)
- DO NOT include any production/deployment scripts yet
- Use Vite for dev server
- All routes must be defined and structured cleanly (/, /about, /register, /login, /feed, /mint, /admin)

🛠️ Pages to Build:
- `/`: Homepage
    - Headline: “Where AI Meets Education”
    - Subtext: “A community platform for teachers, parents, and educators building the future”
    - CTA Buttons: [Join Now] [Login] [Explore Feed]
    - Graphics: Diverse students, classrooms, AI visuals (placeholder images)
- `/about`: About Page
    - Text: “Deep3 Social is a platform built to empower educators and families to share, learn, and grow together around the intersection of AI and education.”
    - Include “Our Mission”, “Why Education + Web3”, and “Moderation Promise” sections.
- `/register`: Registration (email, name, password)
- `/login`: Login
- `/create-profile`: Upload profile picture, select role (teacher/parent/educator)
- `/feed`: Main feed with timeline-style posts
- `/mint`: Mint content (text + media) into NFT, only place where wallet appears
- `/admin`: Admin-only dashboard for user approvals, role assignment, and deletions

🔒 Agent Behavior Rules:
- Never auto-approve users with personal emails (gmail/hotmail/yahoo)
- Only show checkmarks to verified teacher accounts
- All moderation actions must be logged (use moderation_logs collection in Firestore)
- Admin email: derrickshaw@playpulseai.com must have superadmin role
- Only show wallet UI on the mint page

🚨 Security:
- No smart contract integration yet — prepare the system, but do not deploy any contract logic
- Mint function can be simulated with “Mint coming soon” state

✅ GOAL:
Get the platform fully rebuilt and running locally. All front-end logic, Firebase integration, profile management, and feed visibility must be working. Save minting logic for last.
