 SYSTEM PROMPT (Master Build – Deep3 Social B3 Platform)

    Don’t break anything. Don’t rename anything. Don’t remove critical features. This is a clean rebuild of Deep3 Social (B3), the Web3 education-first social platform. All six Firebase components are already configured in the secrets.

🌐 Project Overview

You are rebuilding a web-based social media platform called Deep3 Social (B3), focused exclusively on AI and education. It is designed for:

    Teachers

    Educators

    Parents

All content must relate to AI or education. The platform includes AI moderation agents that automatically monitor and flag non-relevant or inappropriate posts.
🔐 Authentication System

    Use Firebase Authentication (already set up)

    Registration: Email, full name, password

    After signup, users are redirected to create profile

    Admin can approve and verify teacher/educator accounts via work email (no Gmail/Yahoo/etc.)

    Verified users receive a checkmark badge

    Admin email: derrickshaw@playpulseai.com (superadmin with full rights)

🧱 Core Features
✅ User Profile

    Upload profile picture

    Display name and role (Teacher, Parent, Educator)

    Bio (optional)

    Banner image (optional)

✅ Feed System

    Custom feed algorithm (like Bluesky)

    Public feed visible to all users

    Supports: image posts, video posts, likes, shares

    Every post must include category tags (e.g. #ai, #education, #edtech)

✅ Content Creation

    Users can:

        Post images

        Post videos

        Caption posts

        Tag posts (AI, education, subject, etc.)

✅ Moderation System

    AI Moderation Agent 1 – Scans posts for non-AI/education content

    AI Moderation Agent 2 – Monitors substitute teacher agent for compliance

    Flagged content goes to admin for review

    Build Moderation Dashboard for admin

🧪 NFT Minting (Prep Only)

    Prepare the minting system UI

    No contract integration yet

    Show wallet selection only when user attempts to mint

    Include default placeholder text: “Wallet required to mint (Foxfire, Metamask, etc.)”

    Allow:

        Teachers to mint test scores, documents

        Parents to mint child’s achievement

        Educators to mint awards or milestones

🎯 Transaction Fees

    Display minting fee structure on the site (UI only)

    Include a placeholder fee breakdown section

📊 Admin Dashboard

    Admin login via Firebase

    Access:

        User list and filtering (Teachers, Parents, Educators)

        Account approval and role verification

        Delete, suspend, or verify accounts

        View moderation logs

        View flagged content

        Analytics panel (basic activity tracking)

🧠 Other Notes

    Use Firebase Firestore for:

        Users

        Posts

        NFTs

        Moderation logs

        Flags

    Use Firebase Storage for media (uploads/images/videos)

    Use Firebase Hosting (optional, for deployment later)

🛑 Restrictions

    ✅ Use Firebase (preconfigured)

    🚫 Do not integrate any smart contract yet

    🚫 Do not auto-connect wallet or include Web3 libraries by default

    🚫 Do not require wallet for signup or login

    🚫 Do not break working features (hot reload, media upload, user management)

Once this full build is complete, the final step will be smart contract integration and wallet connection. Until then, everything must be functional using Firebase only.
