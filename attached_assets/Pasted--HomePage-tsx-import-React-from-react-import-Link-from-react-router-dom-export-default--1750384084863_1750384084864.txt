        About BEAT3 Social
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        BEAT3 Social is a next-generation platform where educators, parents, and AI advocates come together to spotlight academic growth, educational moments, and digital creativity. We are reimagining social media as a space where learning is the trend.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Our mission is to create a safe, smart, and empowering environment for teachers and families to connect over school wins, projects, and new AI tools in education. Every post is about growth, knowledge, and possibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Built with Firebase, powered by AI, and backed by Web3 (but only when needed), our platform supports image and video uploads, tokenized recognition of achievements, and strict moderation to keep the focus on learning.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        If it’s not about AI or education, it doesn’t belong. That’s the BEAT3 Social standard.
